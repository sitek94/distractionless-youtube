# Distractionless YouTube

A YouTube clone with additional functionality to toggle the visibility of distracting sections like comments and recommended videos.

## Why?

Very often, when I'm watching a youtube video, I find myself distracted either by recommended videos or by comments section.

## Solution

Add "visibility togglers" next to the distracting sections. This way, if you actually want to take a look at the comments section 
to find a link for example, you are still able to that.
